          <p>On the thrid spot we have Naruto since its one of my favorite anime that I've watched. It's in my third spot because I enjoy watching every fight and the story it tells. It also led me to discover similar anime.</p>

        <div class="slide">
          <img src="images/bleach.jpg" alt="Bleach series logo">
          <p>On the second spot Bleach is an anime with a very interesting story and epic sword fights. Its fights and animation are why it holds the second spot on my list.</p>

        <div class="slide">
          <img src="images/yugioh.jpg" alt="Yu-Gi-Oh series logo">
          <p>Yu-Gi-Oh is my number one favorite because I started watching and playing it in 4th grade. I still collect and treasure my cards, with Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds being my favorite series.</p>
